Author: leow149 <leow149@lucidmail.xyz>
Subject: arm64: allwinner: add TrimUI Smart Pro (A133) board support

This commit introduces board support for the TrimUI Smart Pro handheld. It
adds the required device tree, panel driver, and PWM driver, while adapting
the sun4i display pipeline (TCON, DSI, mixer, TCON TOP) to support the A133
Plus SoC's CPU/8080 DSI routing.

[Severity: High]
Does the DSI retrigger timer continue to poll DSI registers after the DSI
module's clocks are gated?

The DRM atomic commit sequence calls encoder->disable before crtc->disable.
sun6i_dsi_encoder_disable() disables dsi->mod_clk and asserts dsi->reset,
but the 2ms dsi_retrigger_timer is only cancelled here during the CRTC
disable phase.

If the timer fires in the window between encoder disable and CRTC disable
(or runs continuously if TRIGGER_START never clears),
sun4i_tcon_dsi_retrigger_timer_fn() will call sun6i_dsi_read_int_status()
and attempt to read powered-down registers, causing a fatal bus fault.

[Severity: High]
Does this unconditional early return break VBLANK interrupts and page flips
for all existing DSI boards?

Because sun4i_tcon0_mode_set_cpu() now sets tcon->dsi_cpu_mode =3D true for
all DRM_MODE_ENCODER_DSI encoders, this causes the hardware VBLANK interrupt
to never be enabled for older TCONs.

[Severity: High]
Can this unconditional application of the A133-specific manual DSI
re-triggering logic override the normal free-running hardware state for
other boards?

This enables the manual DSI CPU mode unconditionally for all DSI interfaces
without checking a quirk or SoC version, which introduces a regression for
existing sun4i-drm DSI users (e.g., A64, A83T).

[Severity: Medium]
Will this lead to an infinite IRQ storm by unconditionally bypassing
IRQ_NONE?

This logic unconditionally accepts the interrupt as handled if
dsi_cpu_mode is true, preventing the genirq subsystem from disabling
the line on an unhandled storm.

[Severity: Medium]
Could this result in an infinite loop if another bit is driving the IRQ lin=
e?

If an unhandled bit (e.g., TRI_COUNTER_INT) is set, it will not be cleared
since this update only targets four specific bits.

Because the handler unconditionally returns IRQ_HANDLED in dsi_cpu_mode,
the GIC will immediately re-fire the level interrupt causing a kernel
hard lockup.

[Severity: Medium]
Could this unconditional reordering of DSI_START_HSC before
drm_panel_prepare() break existing panels?

Existing panels that expect the DSI clock lane to remain in Low Power (LP)
mode during their DCS initialization may fail to configure correctly.

The commit message acknowledges this is a global change and was not verified
against other panels sharing the driver.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but is it possible for unbinding the
sun8i_tcon_top driver via sysfs to clear its drvdata, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference here?

The sun8i_tcon_top_platform_driver lacks a remove function. If unbound via
sysfs, the device core clears the device's drvdata to NULL.

Because DRM is unaware the component is gone (no component_del is called),
a subsequent modeset calling this function will retrieve a NULL tcon_top
and crash on the spinlock access.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does this share the exact
same architectural vulnerability as sun8i_tcon_top_set_dsi_gate()?

A sysfs unbind clearing drvdata will cause a NULL pointer dereference here
when tcon_top is accessed.
