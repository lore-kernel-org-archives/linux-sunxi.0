I feel like we've discussed it already under v1 or elsewhere.

This is a weird pattern you sometimes see where a driver allocates
something and passes the ownership to the subsystem.  This often
causes confusion among driver authors, who logically assume that if
you allocate something, you are responsible for freeing it. Since this
is C and not Rust (where such things are tracked by the compiler), I
strongly believe we should strive to keep ownership consistent: the
driver should free resources it allocated within the bounds of the
lifetime of the device it controls. The subsystem should manage the
data it allocated - in this case the i2c adapter struct device.

I know there are a lot of places where this is done in the kernel but
let's not introduce new ones. This is a bad pattern.

But even if you decided this is the way to go, I fail to see how it
would be easier than what I'm trying to do. You would have to modify
*all* I2C bus drivers as opposed to only modifying those that access
the underlying struct device. Or am I missing something?
