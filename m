commit 621578b5ce602b599c8bef0b18966f05081671b7
Author: Albert Esteve <aesteve@redhat.com>

drm/bridge: release panel reference on all lookup exit paths

of_drm_find_panel() and drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge() now return a
counted reference that the caller must release with drm_panel_put().

For bridge drivers that immediately wrap the panel in a panel_bridge
(which acquires its own reference), release the lookup reference right
after the bridge creation call.

[Severity: Medium]
Since the lookup functions now return a counted reference, does this
change introduce memory leaks on driver probe error paths?

If a driver successfully acquires the panel reference during probe or
attach, but a subsequent initialization step fails (like clock
registration, component addition, or memory allocation), it appears the
reference is leaked if drm_panel_put is not called before returning the
error.

For example, in exynos_dp_probe, if component_add fails, the panel
reference is not released. Similar leaks appear to happen on error
paths in analogix_dp_aux_done_probing, sun6i_dsi_attach,
tegra_output_probe, and lvds_probe.

[Severity: Medium]
Additionally, are there missing conversions for drivers that wrap the
panel in a bridge?

The commit message notes that bridge drivers immediately wrapping the
panel must release the lookup reference right after the bridge creation
call, since the bridge acquires its own reference.

However, it looks like several drivers were missed, such as
lvds_codec_probe, fsl_ldb_probe, lt9211_parse_dt, ssd2825_probe,
tc358767_probe, and tc358768_probe. In these functions, the panel is
wrapped with devm_drm_panel_bridge_add or drm_panel_bridge_add_typed,
but the initial lookup reference is never dropped.

[Severity: High]
Does this create a use-after-free window?

By dropping the last reference to the panel here, the panel object might
be freed. However, the bridge is removed after this step. During this
window, the bridge remains globally visible and registered.

If a concurrent drm commit or modeset (like an atomic disable) executes
on the display pipeline before drm_bridge_remove is called, it could
invoke the bridge callbacks which would dereference the already-freed
panel pointer.

Would it be safer to unregister the bridge before dropping the reference
to the internal structures it relies on?

[Severity: High]
Could this also trigger a use-after-free for the panel?

Similar to the anx6345 driver, the panel reference is dropped before the
bridge is removed. A concurrent atomic disable could execute in this
window and dereference the freed panel inside the bridge callbacks.
