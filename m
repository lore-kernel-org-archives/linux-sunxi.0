Hi,

thanks for the report!

Just for the records: this paragraph above would have been enough, with 
that hint it's pretty obvious that it's wrong.
If you have tested it in a before-after/broken-works fashion, you could 
mention this, but there is little need in going full bit details on 
something that's quite obvious.
So could you show that something doesn't work with the current code, but 
got fixed with some changes? Like the eMMC situation on the A523?

What is the big problem with just extending the code to use 2 bits, for 
the A733? I sketched that here, looks pretty harmless, and is just a few 
lines.
The A523-R problem is more annoying, since Allwinner mixes and matches 
again here: the A733 register layout, but at an A523 offset. And I 
missed that part, which means it effectively breaks compatibility with 
the A523-R, so this needs more fixes, including the DT binding.

Cheers,
Andre
