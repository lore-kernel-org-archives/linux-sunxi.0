While H264 and HEVC are similar in many ways, Cedrus uses two different cor=
es=20
or in Cedrus slang, engines, for them. They have their own quirks. One of t=
he=20
most apparent is handling of DPB array. H264 requires that same entry is=20
always at the same position in HW DPB. That's not required by HEVC.

Additional reasons for differences come from the fact that it's from two=20
different authors (Maxime and Paul). Those differences were created at the=
=20
beginning and it is what it is.

Maybe there is no need to backport, but the change is nevertheless useful. =
As=20
I explained, current code works only by chance, as we noticed with Ezequiel=
's=20
rework. It's certainly worthwhile to make code less brittle. As far as I'm=
=20
concerned, fixes tag can be dropped or even Ezequiel can squash this change=
=20
into his commit, with appropriate adjustments, of course.

I'm not completely sure what do you mean by syncing driver preference. Code=
=20
changes always need a good reason to be accepted. Moving code around and=20
renaming things just to be similar with something else is not.
