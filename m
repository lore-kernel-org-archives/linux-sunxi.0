Seems like we've reached an agreement and can stop arguing but you
make it sound here like I'm somehow against reference counting. I've
never said anything like that and here, I just explained how reference
counting works and what it imposes on users.

That's not true, the changes provide a helper to that end.

It absolutely *can* be done differently. There's nothing that imposes
a certain API design on susbsystems. If you design the subsystem code
well, provider drivers don't need more than one reference (taken in
probe(), released in remove(), for instance via the
register()/unregister() pair) so the counting can be hidden within the
subsystems that control them.
