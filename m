Thank you for your contribution! Sashiko AI review found 5 potential issue(=

New issues:
- [High] The patch unconditionally adds the active descriptor `pchan->desc`=

ption and a potential use-after-free for non-cyclic transfers.

Pre-existing issues:
- [High] A TOCTOU race condition between `sun6i_dma_interrupt()` and `sun6i=
_dma_terminate_all()` allows the interrupt handler to dereference a NULL `p=
chan->desc` pointer.
- [High] Use-after-free when calculating residue for a recently completed t=

- [High] Deadlock risk due to acquiring `sdev->lock` with plain `spin_lock(=

dmaengine: sun6i-dma: Fix memory leak in sun6i_dma_terminate_all

This commit fixes a memory leak in sun6i_dma_terminate_all() for non-cyclic
DMA transfers. It ensures that both cyclic and non-cyclic active descriptors
are added to the desc_completed list before setting pchan->desc to NULL.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but just above this line in
sun6i_dma_terminate_all(), there is a plain spin_lock() used in process
context:

	spin_lock(&sdev->lock);
	list_del_init(&vchan->node);
	spin_unlock(&sdev->lock);

Does this risk an infinite spinlock deadlock? Since sun6i_dma_terminate_all=
()
is callable from process context, a hardirq can preempt execution while
sdev->lock is held. When the hardirq finishes, the pending softirqs would r=
un
sun6i_dma_tasklet on the same CPU, which attempts to acquire the lock using
spin_lock_irqsave(&sdev->lock, flags), potentially deadlocking.

[Severity: High]
Does unconditionally adding the descriptor to desc_completed risk list
corruption for non-cyclic transfers?

When a non-cyclic transfer completes, sun6i_dma_interrupt() calls
vchan_cookie_complete(), which places the descriptor on vc->desc_completed,
sets pchan->done =3D pchan->desc, and schedules the vchan_complete tasklet.
However, pchan->desc isn't cleared until sun6i_dma_tasklet runs.

If sun6i_dma_terminate_all() executes during this window, it observes a
non-NULL pchan->desc and executes list_add_tail() again. Since the descript=
or
is already on the list (or has been spliced/freed by the completion tasklet=
),
this double-add could corrupt the linked list pointers. Should this check
if (pchan->desc !=3D pchan->done) first?

[ ... ]

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but is there a TOCTOU race condition between
sun6i_dma_interrupt() and sun6i_dma_terminate_all()?

In sun6i_dma_interrupt(), pchan->vchan is read locklessly. If
sun6i_dma_terminate_all() runs concurrently on another CPU, it can acquire =
the
channel lock, set pchan->desc =3D NULL, and release the lock:

CPU1 (sun6i_dma_terminate_all):
    if (pchan) {
        ...
        pchan->desc =3D NULL;
    }

CPU2 (sun6i_dma_interrupt):
    spin_lock(&vchan->vc.lock);
    vchan_cookie_complete(&pchan->desc->vd);

Could this cause a fatal NULL pointer dereference when &pchan->desc->vd
evaluates to NULL inside vchan_cookie_complete()?


[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does sun6i_dma_tx_status() have a
use-after-free risk when calculating residue?

When a transfer finishes, the vchan_complete tasklet completes the callback
and frees the descriptor memory. However, pchan->desc is not cleared until
the separate sun6i_dma_tasklet runs.

If dmaengine_tx_status() is called in this window, vchan_find_desc() returns
NULL, and the code falls back to checking pchan && pchan->desc. It then cal=
ls
sun6i_get_chan_size(pchan), which accesses the descriptor:

drivers/dma/sun6i-dma.c:sun6i_get_chan_size() {
    ...
    for (lli =3D txd->v_lli; lli; lli =3D lli->v_lli_next) {
    ...
}

Will this dereference the already-freed descriptor memory?


[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does the interrupt handler risk premature=
ly
completing a newly started transfer?

sun6i_dma_terminate_all() stops the physical channel but leaves pending
interrupt bits set in the hardware DMA_IRQ_STAT register. The
sun6i_dma_tasklet can immediately reallocate this physical channel to a
new virtual channel and start it.

If the delayed hardware interrupt from the old transfer fires,
sun6i_dma_interrupt() reads pchan->vchan locklessly:

drivers/dma/sun6i-dma.c:sun6i_dma_interrupt() {
    ...
    vchan =3D pchan->vchan;
    if (vchan && (status & vchan->irq_type)) {
    ...
}

If it evaluates as the newly assigned vchan, and non-cyclic transfers share
the same irq_type bitmask, could the handler incorrectly acquire the new
vchan->vc.lock and prematurely complete the new transfer's descriptor?
