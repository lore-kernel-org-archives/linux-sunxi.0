I read what you said! This question seemed to me as another variant of
"what happens when one vendor implements an extension from a different
vendor", and since we already discussed that I was trying to figure out
what you were actually asking.

Thank you for expanding upon this idea further. This solution of
indexing the extensions based on the vendor who proposed them does make
a lot of sense. There are some key differences here of note. When
vendors are able to mix vendor extensions, defining a bitmask that
contains all of the vendor extensions gets a bit messier. I see two
possible solutions.

1. Vendor keys cannot overlap between vendors. A set bit in the bitmask
is associated with exactly one extension.

2. Vendor keys can overlap between vendors. There is a vendor bitmask
per vendor. When setting/checking a vendor extension, first index into
the vendor extension bitmask with the vendor associated with the
extension and then with the key of the vendor extension.

A third option would be to use the standard extension framework. This
causes the standard extension list to become populated with extensions
that most harts will never implement so I am opposed to that.

This problem carries over into hwprobe since the schemes proposed by
Evan and I both rely on the mvendorid of harts associated with the
cpumask. To have this level of support in hwprobe for SoCs with a mix of
vendors but the same extensions I again see two options:

1. Vendor keys cannot overlap between vendors. A set bit in the bitmask
is associated with exactly one extension. This bitmask would be returned
by the vendor extension hwprobe key.

2. Vendor keys can overlap between vendors. There is an hwprobe key per
vendor. Automatic resolution of the vendor doesn't work because the
vendor-specific feature being requested (extensions in the case) may be
of a vendor that is different than the hart's vendor, in otherwords
there are two variables necessary: the vendor and a way to ask hwprobe
for a list of the vendor extensions. With hwprobe there is only the
"key" that can be used to encode these variables simultaneously. We
could have something like a HWPROBE_THEAD_EXT_0 key that would return
all thead vendor extensions supported by the harts corresponding to the
cpumask.

I didn't list the option that we shove all of the vendor extensions into
the same fields that are used for standard extensions because that will
fill up the standard extension probing with all of the vendor extensions
that most SoCs will not care about.

The second option for hwprobe is nice because there are "only" 64 values
supported in the returned bitmask so if there ends up being a lot of
vendor extensions that need to be exposed, then we would end up with a
lot of unused bits on most systems.

For the internal kernel structures it matters less (or doesn't matter at
all) since it's not exposed to userspace and it can always change.
Having consistency is nice for developers though so it would be my
preference to have schemes that reflect each other for the in-kernel
structures and hwprobe.

Thank you for working this problem out with me. I know there is a lot of
text I am pushing here, hopefully we can design something that doesn't
need to be re-written in the future.
