Really? I basically ended up doing what I mentioned in my original
reply. next-20220726 should have my changes that'll make sure
fw_devlink doesn't block any probe (it'll still try to create as many
device links as possible) after 10s (default deferred probe timeout).
Can you try to find more info on why it's not probing?
<debugfs>/devices_deferred should give more details.
