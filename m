Yeah, it arguably is, and Jernej had early patches already two years ago,
I think. However there are some changes in the IP that require some rework
in the DE driver for proper support, IIUC, so the upstreaming is somewhat
on hold.
Of course this didn't prevent Armbian from taking those early patches
anyway, so a lot of people are not even aware of the problem :-(

Andre
