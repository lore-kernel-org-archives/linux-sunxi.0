What do you mean with "more consistent", exactly?
I still don't get why NO_REPARENT would help here in the first place:
we have three clocks as potential parents: OSC24MHz, PLL_PERIPH0,
PLL_PERIPH1. The first one is too slow for typical MMC rates, and
PERIPH1 is typically disabled (it's the same rates as PERIPH0, so
there is little need for it). So PERIPH0 is to clock to go, and I don't
see what NO_REPARENT would change here.

So those are my observations:
With NO_REPARENT (current mainline):
- SD card fails to probe:
  sunxi-mmc 4020000.mmc: fatal err update clk timeout
- SD card is still parented to PERIPH0-2x (probably because U-Boot set
  that up), but uses a divider of 256 for a clock rate of 4687500 Hz.
  This probably leads to the failures.
- eMMC works, but is parented to the 24MHz OSC, probably because U-Boot
  did not touch it. The clock rate is 12MHz, the read speed is 10MB/s.
With removing NO_REPARENT, so with this patch:
- SD cards probes, I can mount a VFAT fs on it, and sometimes "ls"
  that, but it hangs soon afterwards, for instance when trying to
  benchmark it.
- SD clock is set up correctly: parent is PLL_PERIPH0-2x, rate is 50
  MHz, correct for High Speed@4bit and its 25MB/s bus speed.
- eMMC works fine, clock parent is PLL-PERIPH0-2x, rate is 100 MHz,
  correct for HS-200 (100 MHz * 8 bit * 2(DDR)). The read speed is
  72MB/s, which sounds alright, and might be a limitation of the flash
  chip.

So NO_REPARENT is always worse for me.

This patch would be a fix anyway (with a Fixes: tag), so we can push it
still into 6.13, after -rc1, and it would be backported. So it's not as
critical, timing-wise.
