Hi,

this is v3 of the series by Martin, now complemented by patches to fix
the problem with way-too-high temperatures reported on some boards. This
seems to be related to the firmware being run, because the vendor U-Boot
contains a hack avoiding this problem. Some investigation and digging
in BSP code later we identified that bit 16 in register 0x3000000
(SYS_CFG) needs to be cleared for the raw temperature register values to
contain reasonable values.
To achieve this, patch 1/6 exports this very register from the already
existing syscon device. Patch 4/6 then adds code to the thermal driver
to find the syscon device via a new DT property, and query its regmap to
clear bit 16 in there.

I am not fully convinced this is the best solution, but it works for me.
What leaves a bit of a bitter taste is that the SRAM driver (the one
exporting the regmap) also uses this register, to switch some SRAM C
region to the video engine (VE). Experiments show that only bit 0 in
this register is doing this job, so the current mask covering the 31
LSBs should probably be amended to only cover bit 0.
Another solution could be to model this bit as an SRAM switch, and let
the THS driver claim some (dummy?) SRAM region from the syscon/SRAM driver
directly. While this sounds cleaner to some degree, I don't think there
is really such a THS SRAM region, so it's not fully correct either.

I would appreciate any feedback on this, happy to implement the other
approach, if that's desired.

The rest of the patches is mostly unchanged from Martin's v2, just
updated and massaged the commit messages a bit. I also added patch 3/6
to document some so-far unknown register value.

Please have a look!

Cheers,
Andre
