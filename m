I don't think it's the right way forward. It makes the core logic more
complicated, for something that is redundant with the notifiers
mechanism that has been the go-to for that kind of things so far.

It's not really obvious to me why the notifiers don't work there.

Is it because of the "The callbacks associated with the notifier must
not re-enter into the clk framework by calling any top-level clk APIs."
comment?

If so, I think the thing we should emphasize is that it's about *any
top-level clk API*, as in clk_set_rate() or clk_set_parent().

The issue is that any consumer-facing API is taking the clk_prepare lock
and thus we would have reentrancy. But we're a provider there, and none
of the clk_hw_* functions are taking that lock. Neither do our own function.

So we could call in that notifier our set_rate callback directly, or we
could create a clk_hw_set_rate() function.

The first one will create cache issue between the actual rate that the
common clock framework is running and the one we actually enforced, but
we could create a function to flush the CCF cache.

The second one is probably simpler.


Another option could be that we turn clk_set_rate_exclusive into
something more subtle that allows to change a parent rate as long as the
clock rate doesn't. It would ease the requirement that
clk_set_rate_exclusive() has on a clock subtree (which I think prevents
its usage to some extent), but I have no issue on how that would work in
practice.

So yeah, I think adding a clk_hw_set_rate() that would be callable from
a notifier is the right way forward there.
