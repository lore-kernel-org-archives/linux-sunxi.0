You are correct, this value was picked based on existing values used by
other drivers:

  exynos/exynos_hdmi.c:#define HOTPLUG_DEBOUNCE_MS                1100
  bridge/ti-tfp410.c:#define HOTPLUG_DEBOUNCE_MS          1100
  amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.h:#define AMDGPU_DM_MAX_HDMI_HPD_DEBOUNCE_MS 5000
  rockchip/dw_hdmi_qp-rockchip.c:#define HOTPLUG_DEBOUNCE_MS              150

150 ms was too short for my test monitor (Raspberry Pi Monitor), it
does a HPD low voltage level pulse when powering on of around 200+ ms.

  [82.641903] dw_hdmi_hardirq: EVENT=plugout
  [82.841939] dw_hdmi_hardirq: EVENT=plugin

And on my LG OLED 4K TV there was typically a pulse of around 700-900 ms.
So the 1.1 seconds used by other drivers seemed like a good candidate :-)

Your analysis is correct, any HPD event would keep debouncing adding 1.1
timout from each HPD irq, both plugout and plugin.

The intention was to allow for up to 1.1 seconds to pass between a
plugout and a plugin, before we treated a plugout as a full disconnect
event, and not to delay a possible connected event by 1.1 seconds.

Correct, as long as the pulse was less than 1.1 seconds.

Good catch and I agree, we should delay/timeout the disconnected state
longer than plugin and react on plugin almost immediately.

We can configure different delays for plugout and plugin, I am currently
testing something like following:

  #define HOTPLUG_CONNECTED_DEBOUNCE_MS		150
  #define HOTPLUG_DISCONNECTED_DEBOUNCE_MS	500

  delay = status == connector_status_connected ?
		    HOTPLUG_CONNECTED_DEBOUNCE_MS :
		    HOTPLUG_DISCONNECTED_DEBOUNCE_MS;
  mod_delayed_work(system_percpu_wq, &hdmi->hpd_work,
		   msecs_to_jiffies(delay));

That would mean:
- at plugout we (re-)start the timer to trigger in 500ms
- at plugin we (re-)start the timer to trigger in 150ms
- whenever the timer triggers the hpd_work is started
- the hpw_work trigger normal detect() handling to determin if
  connector status (or EDID) has changed

Example during power on of a Raspberry Pi Monitor:

  [82.648276] dw_hdmi_schedule_hpd_work(status=2)

Around 205ms between HPD=0 and HPD=1 and around 160ms from plugin until
delayed hpd_work starts.

And at full plugout the debounce time is around 497 ms:

With a much quicker reaction on plugin event maybe the 1.1 seconds could
stay to avoid having to do a full teardown, disable() + enable() cycle,
at slightly longer HPD pulses.

Or maybe it is time to re-spin an old cec-adapter debounce series [1]
that can allow for some additional time until the CEC phys addr is fully
invalidated at a longer HPD low voltage level pulse.
