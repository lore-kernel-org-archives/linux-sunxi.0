Sure, that doesn't seem to be the case in the impacted systems though -
AFAICT the issue with these is that it's a generic SoC DT that's not
fully fleshed out, either because more data is needed for the silicon or
because the numbers need to be system specific for some reason.

I'm not clear a trip point prevent userspace polling if it feels so
moved?  Is it just that it makes it more likely that someone will
implement something that polls?

I can see printing a loud warning given that the system is not fully
configured (there's a warning already, I did nearly comment on this
patch downgrading it all the way to a debug log), perhaps even
suppressing the registraton of the userspace interface, but returning a
failure to the registering driver feels like it's escalating the problem
and complicating the driver code.  Suppressing the registration to
userspace seemed like it was adding more complexity in the core but it
would avoid any potential confusion for userspace.

For me the main issue is the impact on devices that support multiple
thermal zones, in order to avoid having working zones stay registered
their drivers will all have to handle the possibility of some of the
zones failing to register due to missing configuration which is going to
add complexity both at both registration and runtime and be easy to miss.
If the core just accepts the zones then whatever complexity there is
gets factored out into the core.
