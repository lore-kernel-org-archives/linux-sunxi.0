Right we definitely need to keep the order of the L0/L1 lists even with mis=
sing
references and the question is whether the hardware can deal with it or not.

Our uAPI specification currently doesn't say anything about handling missing
references. I'm generally not very keen on considering that undefined behav=
ior
becomes de-facto uAPI that should never be broken, because there are cases =
where
it is obviously incorrect and the fact that it didn't fail previously is the
result of a bug in the implementation.

But in this situation I agree we do need a way to indicate that references =
are
missing and using 0xff sounds like a good plan to me, given that we provide=
 a
uAPI header define with this value and that the doc mentions it.

Okay I agree that we should not fail in common code and tolerate a value to
indicate a missing reference.

What the current proposal is doing (skipping the reference) results in the
SRAM entry for the reference remaining untouched, which will keep its value
=66rom the previous frame. This seems clearly incorrect.

It sounds like an approach that could work for cedrus too.

I think it make sense yes, but it would be good to document it in the uAPI
document too.

All the best,
