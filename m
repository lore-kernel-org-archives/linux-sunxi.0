commit 2a1faaf3f9e395a5ec4a2a530f311f244c0a15e3
Author: leow149 <leow149@lucidmail.xyz>
Subject: arm64: allwinner: add TrimUI Smart Pro (A133) board support

This patch brings up board support for the TrimUI Smart Pro handheld.
It introduces new DTS configuration, panel timings for OTM1289A, a
new PWM driver, and modifies TCON/DSI files for CPU/8080 interface
bring-up.

[Severity: High]
Is it possible these horizontal porch values are swapped?

The DRM front porch is calculated as htotal - hdisplay - hbp=20
(880 - 720 - 88 =3D 72). However, in otm1289a_mode, hsync_start is set to=20
OTM1289A_HDISPLAY + 88, which uses the vendor's back porch value instead of=
=20
the computed front porch offset of 72.

Could this cause incorrect display output shifting when the hardware is=20
configured?

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to call sleeping functions from this atomic context?

The DRM subsystem architectural guidelines specify that encoder atomic enab=
le=20
and disable callbacks execute in an atomic context where sleeping is strict=
ly=20
forbidden.

The panel's prepare and disable hooks (which are invoked from the encoder=20
enable/disable paths) use msleep().

Could this lead to kernel warnings, system instability, or deadlocks during=
=20
display modesets?

[Severity: High]
Does taking this mutex pose a sleep-in-atomic hazard?

This PWM apply hook is reachable from the panel enable hook via a backlight=
=20
update. Since the panel enable hook runs from the encoder atomic enable=20
context where sleeping is prohibited, acquiring a sleeping mutex here viola=
tes=20
subsystem constraints.

[Severity: High]
Does this disable_irq() call violate the DRM atomic context rules?

The function is called directly by sun6i_dsi_encoder_disable(), which is an=
=20
encoder atomic callback. Although the comment states it runs in process=20
context, the DRM guidelines classify encoder atomic callbacks as atomic=20
contexts where sleeping functions are forbidden.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but could this write-0-to-clear sequence=20
drop hardware interrupts?

SUN4I_TCON_GINT0_REG is a write-0-to-clear register. The regmap_update_bits=
()=20
call reads the register and unconditionally writes 0 to the specified mask.

If an interrupt such as TRI_FINISH_INT asserts after the initial regmap_rea=
d()=20
but before the regmap_update_bits() write, the unconditional 0-write clears=
=20
it. Since it was not in the original status snapshot, the handler will not=
=20
process it, resulting in a lost interrupt.

With the high frequency of FSYNC_INT events described in the commit, could=
=20
this TOCTOU race window lead to a permanent display freeze when TRI_FINISH_=
INT=20
is lost?

[Severity: Medium]
Will this retrigger timer ever actually stop?

The timer polls every 2ms and expects to stop when=20
SUN4I_TCON0_CPU_IF_TRI_START is cleared (!busy).

However, when the hardware clears TRI_START at the end of a frame, it=20
immediately asserts TRI_FINISH_INT. The hardirq handler runs and immediatel=
y=20
re-asserts TRI_START to 1.=20

Because the timer runs in a softirq context, it executes after the hardirq.=
=20
Thus, the timer will almost always sample TRI_START as 1, miss the window=20
where it was 0, and continue running continuously as a permanent CPU hog.

[Severity: High]
Could enabling the IRQ here without first clearing pending device-level=20
interrupts cause overlapping transfers?

When the display is re-enabled during a DPMS unblank cycle, this function=20
calls enable_irq() at tick =3D=3D 0. If TRI_FINISH_INT or FSYNC_INT is pend=
ing=20
from a previous session, the hardirq handler will run immediately, preempti=
ng=20
the timer (or running concurrently), and issue a transfer via=20
sun6i_dsi_tri_start().

When enable_irq() returns, the timer proceeds, observes busy =3D=3D false, =
and=20
also issues a transfer. Could this result in two concurrent transfer comman=
ds=20
while a transfer is already in flight, confusing the DSI engine state?
