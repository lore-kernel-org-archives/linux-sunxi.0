The Allwinner H616 PWM controller is quite different from the A10 one.

It can drive six PWM channels and, like the A10 controller, each channel
has a bypass that permits it to output a clock instead of a PWM waveform.

The channels are paired two by two and share a first mux, prescaler and
gate. Each channel then has another prescaler, which is bypassed when
that channel's bypass output is enabled.

The clock structure looks like this:

            _____      ______      ________
OSC24M --->|     |    |      |    |        |
APB1 ----->| Mux |--->| Gate |--->| /div_m |-----> PWM_clock_src_xy
           |_____|    |______|    |________|
                          ________
                         |        |
                      +->| /div_k |---> PWM_clock_x
                      |  |________|
                      |    ______
                      |   |      |
                      +-->| Gate |----> PWM_bypass_clock_x
                      |   |______|
PWM_clock_src_xy -----+   ________
                      |  |        |
                      +->| /div_k |---> PWM_clock_y
                      |  |________|
                      |    ______
                      |   |      |
                      +-->| Gate |----> PWM_bypass_clock_y
                          |______|

Here, xy can be 0/1, 2/3 or 4/5.

Because this is unusually complex for a PWM controller, the driver uses
the Common Clock Framework to manage the clocks.

PWM_clock_x/y serve the PWM function. PWM_bypass_clock_x/y serve the
clock-provider function.

The PWM driver acts as a clock provider for the bypass clocks. This is
needed, for example, by the integrated X-Powers AC200 or AC300 Ethernet
PHY co-packaged with some H616-family SoCs, whose input clock comes from
the PWM5 output.

Normally a fixed clock can be built on a PWM through the pwm-clock
driver. That interface, however, passes an integer-nanosecond period and
50% duty waveform to the PWM provider. Its clock-frequency property is
the rate advertised by pwm-clock; it is not an exact-frequency request
made to the underlying PWM hardware.

For example, pwm-clock represents 24 MHz as a 42 ns period with a 21 ns
duty time. The exhaustive v8 PWM rounding happens to select the H616
bypass and produce 24 MHz for that waveform, but this is a consequence
of the PWM rounding rules, not a contract that the hardware rate equals
the rate advertised by pwm-clock. Exposing the bypass through CCF
instead lets the consumer request an actual clock rate, conveys that
duty-cycle and polarity control are not required, and makes the shared
pair source visible to CCF's rate arbitration.

The H616 block is therefore both a PWM controller and a clock provider
when bypass is enabled.

Why v8 substantially restructures v7
------------------------------------

The v7 driver registered a composite CCF clock for each channel even
though the mux, div_m prescaler and gate belong to a channel pair. That
model made the channels appear independent and allowed one channel's
rate selection to reprogram the active sibling. V8 registers one CCF
clock for each hardware pair and programs only the channel-local div_k
prescaler in the PWM path. Each Linux-managed active output protects the
pair rate, so an incompatible request fails instead of silently changing
the sibling waveform.

Firmware can leave a channel running before Linux has acquired either its
PWM or bypass clock, so CCF reference counts alone cannot describe every
active output. The pair gate and rate-change notifier therefore also
inspect the hardware channel-enable bits. Generic unused-clock cleanup
preserves inherited outputs long enough for declared consumers to claim
them. At driver sync_state(), channels which remain unowned are stopped and
empty shared gates are reconciled through CCF. This prevents both premature
shutdown of a late-probing consumer and indefinite unclaimed outputs.

The bypass clock remains a separate child of the pair clock. PWM request
and clock prepare callbacks arbitrate ownership of the physical output,
while CCF rate protection covers the complete prepared lifetime of a
bypass clock. This models the actual shared resource and avoids encoding
clock intent as a special PWM waveform.

The waveform conversion was also rewritten rather than extending v7's
single-source heuristic. It now enumerates every reachable parent,
div_m, div_k and bypass setting and applies the PWM core's ordered
period, duty and offset rounding rules. This is needed to handle
inverted waveforms, constant levels, the 65536-tick period boundary and
equivalent settings without overflow or an arbitrary parent choice.

Hardware updates are now transactional. The driver waits for a pending
period update to latch, uses live PPR updates only when the input clock,
prescaler and polarity remain safe, and quiesces the channel for rate,
polarity or bypass transitions. A failed pair-rate change is rolled back
before the previous output is restored. This follows the documented
period-ready and PCLK constraints and avoids disturbing an active
sibling. The driver records the active and newly programmed periods to
derive a tight timeout for its own updates. Only an unknown firmware update
falls back to the maximum possible hardware period, and an adaptive sleep
interval bounds the number of MMIO polls even in that case.

Pulse and active dead-zone modes remain unsupported because the PWM API
cannot represent them. A dead-zone enable left behind while both pair
outputs are disabled is only dormant configuration, however, so v8 clears
that state before programming a normal PWM instead of making the channel
unusable until reset.

Finally, all clock topology objects are allocated per device and
registered with managed helpers after reset deassertion. This replaces
v7's mutable static clock templates and manual unwind path, eliminating
cross-device state, lifetime and probe-failure hazards reported during
v7 review.

Runtime validation was performed on an H616 system with a co-packaged
AC300 Ethernet PHY. The PWM5 bypass supplied an exact 24 MHz PHY clock.
PWM waveform tests covered normal and inverted polarity and the 65536-tick
full-duty boundary. PWM4 was exercised concurrently without changing the
active PWM5 clock or Ethernet link, while conflicting PWM5 ownership was
rejected. An injected firmware-active PWM2 bypass remained intact through
probe and unused-clock cleanup, then was stopped at sync_state() because no
consumer claimed it; its now-empty shared pair gate was disabled as well.
An injected firmware-active PWM4 bypass on the same pair was also removed
without changing PWM5's shared gate, rate or Ethernet link. The
firmware-enabled PWM5 bypass was claimed by the AC300 consumer and remained
at exactly 24 MHz with a 100 Mbps link. A dormant dead-zone bit was cleared
before programming and updating a 100 ms waveform, while an active
dead-zone configuration rejected the update without disturbing the running
output.
Full PWM and MAC unbind/rebind recovered successfully, ten cold boots
completed with the 24 MHz clock and 100 Mbps link, and more than 495 MB of
receive traffic completed without RX errors or drops.

This series is based on upstream commit 31996e14bd59.
