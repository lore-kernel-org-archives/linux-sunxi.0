Subject: [PATCH 0/3] mmc: improve API to make clear {h|s}w_reset is for cards

As discussed in 2020 [1], Ulf and I agreed that it would be easier to
understand the {h|s}w_reset mechanisms if it was clear that they are for
cards. This series implements that by changing the parameter to mmc_card
where apropriate. Also, the callback into host drivers has been renamed
to 'card_hw_reset' to make it obvious what exactly the driver is
expected to reset.

I tested it with my Renesas boards, so far no regressions. Buildbots are
currently checking the series.

This series is based on mmc/next as of yesterday. A branch is here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wsa/linux.git renesas/mmc/reset-api-v2

Looking forward to comments. Happy hacking,

   Wolfram
