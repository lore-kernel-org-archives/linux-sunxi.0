drm: bridge: dw_hdmi: Rework HDP and RXSENSE interrupt handling

This commit removes RXSENSE handling to simplify the HPD interrupt handling
and instead depends on a debounced HPD work to refresh the EDID. It also
ensures the initial HPD interrupt polarity is based on current HPD status.

Can this delayed work be re-armed during device removal, leading to a
use-after-free?

In dw_hdmi_remove(), cancel_delayed_work_sync(&hdmi->hpd_work) is called
before the hardware PHY interrupts are muted. Furthermore, the IRQ is
managed by the devm framework, so the handler is not unregistered until
after dw_hdmi_remove() returns.

If an HPD interrupt fires in the window after the work is canceled but
before interrupts are disabled, the IRQ handler will execute and
unconditionally call mod_delayed_work(), placing the work back on the
queue. When the devm framework subsequently frees the hdmi structure, the
queued work remains. When the timer expires, dw_hdmi_hpd_work() will
execute and dereference the freed hdmi pointer.

Also, does this debouncing logic swallow short HPD pulses meant to signal
EDID changes?

HDMI 1.4b specifications state that a sink indicates an EDID change by
driving a low voltage level pulse on the HPD pin for at least 100ms. The
delayed work debounce waits for HOTPLUG_DEBOUNCE_MS.

When a pulse occurs, the timer is queued on the falling edge and
re-queued/extended on the rising edge. When dw_hdmi_hpd_work() finally runs
after the debounce period, the HPD line has returned to high. Because this
steady-state matches the existing connector status,
drm_helper_hpd_irq_event() will not see a status change and thus will not
generate a hotplug event. This completely prevents the system from reading
the new EDID.

Can this overwrite the teardown interrupt mute, leaving interrupts enabled
after the driver unloads?

During device teardown, dw_hdmi_remove() attempts to disable all interrupts
by writing ~0 to this exact register. Since dw_hdmi_remove() does not
synchronize with the IRQ handler (the IRQ is freed by devres only after
remove returns), the IRQ handler can run concurrently and overwrite the
teardown's ~0 with ~HDMI_IH_PHY_STAT0_HPD.

This leaves the PHY interrupts unmuted at the hardware level. Because the
IRQ is registered with IRQF_SHARED, a subsequent HPD hardware event will
assert the shared IRQ line with no registered handler, causing an unhandled
interrupt storm and forcing the kernel to permanently disable the shared
IRQ line.
