It's not weird at all, this is the standard way to handle this. We have
these things called reference counts for a reason.

Drivers are responsible for dropping *their* reference, it doesn't mean
that the resource is necessarily freed immediately as someone else may
be holding a reference. Anyone surprised by this should not be doing
kernel development.

No, it's not. It's literally the standard way of doing this.

Yes, you have to update the allocation and replace container_of() with
dev_get_drvdata() but it's a straight-forward transformation that brings
the i2c subsystem more in line with the driver model (unlike whatever it
is you're trying to do).
