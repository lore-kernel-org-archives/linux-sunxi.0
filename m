Fixing the patch in the simplest sense would be to eagerly get the
mvendorid/marchid without using the cached version. But this assumes
that all harts have the same mvendorid/marchid. This is not something
that I am strongly attached to. If it truly is detrimental to Linux to
allow a user a way to specify different vendorids for different harts
then I will remove that code.
